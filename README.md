# Saveify


## Background and Overview
Saveify is a personal finance tool that gathers publicly available information on historical and current savings rates and provides users with a comparison visualizations that will show them how much they could be saving if they moved their savings into a different account.

Users would be able to input their current savings amount and interest rate and then API calls would be run to fetch data from the top publicly available interest rates.

The graphs and charts provided will show how much more money per month the user could be making by switching to a higher yield savings account and how much more they could be saving in the long run Ideally cost of living data would be available side by side and would show how much the additional savings could help the user based on their geography.

For example the current savings from Chase - one of the nation's largest depositroeies - is offering a paltry interest rate of 0.01% APY, while an online savings account such as Marcus is offering a starting rate of 2.25% APY. With a starting savings amount of $10,000, that is a yearly difference of nearly $225 in savings. The amounts are magnified with a greater amount at start along with monthly contributions.

## Functionality & MVP
